One could then simply write the JSON string to disc, it would not have to be \"parsed\" or formatted in any particular way. Given that _metadata begins with an underscore, it would always be the first key, if we use alphabetical ordering in simplejson.dumps.</p><p><br></p><p>Second, by removing the extra parsing on the server side, we could save the content to disc directly from the browser.
