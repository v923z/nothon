There are several problems with the traditional wiki approach. <br><ol><li>Extra content (images, sound etc.) has to be uploaded to a server, creating a storage/management overhead. Besides, one can never be certain that the image displayed in the wiki is the most recent one. <br></li><li>Formatting cannot be done, and formulae cannot be edited in-place: one has to invoke the editor mode for each section.</li><li>There is no way of creating content in the wiki page itself (we mean data external to the wiki page itself. E.g., a figure/plot has to be created in an external application, and then uploaded to the server).</li><li>There is no way of interacting with the underlying file system. Anything displayed in the wiki is part of the server storage facility, and one cannot obtain information of a particular file on the file system. <br></li></ol><p>The first of the problems was alleviated in the excellent zim-wiki project, which, exactly because it doesn't require a server, works with the underlying file system. In some respect, the third point was also addressed in zim, namely, there is a way of creating plots and formulae on the fly. However, formulae require a LaTeX system, which has its own problems, while the script that generates the plot is hidden. This can be an advantage or disadvantage, depending on the particular situation (or the preferences of the user). But, unfortunately, this is all that can be said about wiki-file system interaction. <br></p><hr>When we set out to develop nothon, we wanted to rectify the above-mentioned problems. However, since the desire was to create a system that can be used for documenting various projects (both experimental, and theoretical/numerical), we also wanted to include tools that would make project management easy. Thus, we envisaged the following features.<br><ol><li>Easy customisation: in terms of both adding extensions, and the look and feel of the wiki. We also thought that customisation is a rather important subject in the sense that we cannot possibly think of all uses, and we wanted to implement a wiki in a way that can be modified via a plug-in infrastructure. <br></li><li>Integration of a (or multiple) scientific plotting utility.&nbsp;</li><li>Some interaction with the file system. This would include accessing the content of data files, and retrieving and highlighting the content of software code. On can also think about saving particular cells of a document. E.g., the script producing a figure could be saved as a stand-alone file. <br></li><li>Portability.<br></li></ol><p>As for the first point, the browser seemed to be a natural choice: given the HTML content, customisation can be done with the help of cascaded stylesheets. In this way, not only could we completely decouple the content from the presentation, but the decoupling would work at the level of the code, too. In other words, the server-client separation naturally lends itself to a double-headed implementation: the server can deal with access to the file system, plotting and the like, while the browser's responsibility is to handle the user interaction, and display the content in whatever way that suits the user.&nbsp; Resorting to the browser has the additional benefit that the content of a notebook can easily converted to a format that is widely used, and portability is not a problem either. <br></p>",

In case the plot cannot be generated (e.g., due to a syntax error in the code), the traceback will be returned instead. A link to the file that was generated is also displayed. If this feature is not required, the corresponding div, .div_plot_file, can be set to <b>display: none;</b> in the CSS.

This can be inserted by pressing Cntr-Alt-M (display style), or Alt-M (inline). By default, formulae will be displayed with a light blue background, but this can be changed in the CSS file. Note that by pressing the hotkey combinations above, the user will be presented with empty math containers. However, it is also possible to turn a piece of text into a math formula. If the above-mentioned hotkeys are pressed while some text is selected, this text will become the body of the math formula. After entering the LaTeX code of the formula, it can be rendered by pressing either Cntr-Enter, or Shift-Enter. The formula can be turned to its raw format for future editing by pressing the 'Raw content' button in the context menu, or the Cntr-L hotkey combination. Both of these actions would remove all formulae in the currently active divide, and insert the corresponding LaTeX code in place. However, if necessary, the LaTeX code of a single formula can be recovered with the left mouse click on the blue background. When the user clicks on the raw LaTeX formula, it will be processed, and rendered. <br><br>References to equations can be added by adding a label to the equation in the usual way, and placing in-line math environment.
